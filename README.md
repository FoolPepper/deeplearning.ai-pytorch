# deeplearning.ai in PyTorch
PyTorch implementations of some assignments which were originally given in tensorflow and/or Keras.
  I might try to implement other assignments in the future as well. I discard numpy notebooks since they are lower level and I don't think it would be useful to implement them in PyTorch.
* You need <b>PyTorch 0.4+</b> to run them locally.<br>
